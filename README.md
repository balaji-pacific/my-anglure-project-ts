Creating this project for understanding the bases of typescript

Type Script is the superset of Java script.
We can write the type script in the filename.ts file extension with type script syntaxes and compile the typescript that will auto generates .js file extension we can use that in the html file. 

We can ignore the compile error during development in javascript, because we are using compiled version of js file.

Installation of Typescript:

Prerequisite : nodejs

Create an empty project 
	1. npm init -y
	2. npm install typescript
	
Debug the file
	• npx tsc file-name.ts 

Compile typescript files:

For compiling single fine use npx tsc file-name.ts 

If we need setup of compiling Typescript files we need a config file
Commend for doing that is 

The below command will create a tsconfig.json file
